## Goals

BY THE END OF THIS SECTION YOU WILL HAVE:
- opened your project on your computer, or in your cloud environment
- started the dev (development) server
- opened a browser preview at `localhost:3000` or in your cloud environment


## Starting a local work session

If your project is not currently open and running in dev mode, open and start your project using the same commands as the previous lessson.

1. Open your astro project (`astro-site`) in your code editor (e.g. VS Code).
You should see a command prompt in the terminal pane at the bottom of your screen, ready to **run commands**
`:~/astro-site$`

2. Type and enter (run) the command `npm run dev`
This will start the Astro dev server, and will prepare your code changes for viewing. While the dev server is running, your terminal will provide feedback such as which page it is rendering while you visit in the browser, and any error messages.

3. Check your browser preview by visiting `localhost:3000` in a browser tab.

This is where you can always view a live, updating preview of your website. Open this URL in a browser tab when you want to see how your code changes are rendered to the page. You may need to refresh the tab to see changes take effect.

## Starting a cloud session

If you are working on your project using a code editor in your web browser (e.g. CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, Gitpod), you will import a fresh copy of your project repository from GitHub.com.

1. Navigate to your dashboard and open your project repository:

In CodeSandbox, you will fork your master copy: https://codesandbox.io/dashboard/repositories

In StackBlitz, you will open your recent project: https://stackblitz.com/dashboard


2. Wait for the project to load in dev mode

You will see a small preview window right on your screen with a URL from the online site you are using (e.g. `https://sdkelkk--github--3000.localwebcontainer.io/` or `https://dfewi.sse.codesandbox.io/`). When your project has finished loading, this will be a live preview of your project.

3. Check your browser preview by visiting `localhost:3000` in a browser tab.

This is where you can always view a live, updated version of your website. You may need to refresh the tab to see changes take effect.


## Using the Astro dev server

While the Astro server is running in dev mode, you will NOT be able to run commands in your terminal window. Instead, this pane will give you feedback as you preview your site.

You can stop the dev server at any time and return to the command prompt by typing `CTRL+C`.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes the dev server will stop on its own while you are working. If your live preview at `localhost:3000` or in your online editor preview stops working, go back to the terminal and restart the dev server by typing `npm run dev`.
