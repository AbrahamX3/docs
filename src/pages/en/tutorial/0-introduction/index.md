## Guided Tutorial

In this tutorial, you will build a fully-functioning Astro blog website, step-by-step, taking you from zero to full launch! ðŸš€

Along the way, you'll see core Astro concepts like **partial hydration**, **component-based composition** and **file routing** in action. 

You'll build with Astro using established web development practices such as **refactoring**, **semantic HTML tags**, and **mobile-first, responsive design**. 

And you wiil also learn how to:
- set up your development environnment and start a new project
- create and edit pages for your website
- build with Astro components
- use Astro's run-time API
- add interativity to your site


:::note
 If you would rather start exploring Astro with a pre-built Astro site, you can visit https://astro.new and choose a starter template to open and edit in a in an online editor.

:::tip
You can also visit https://astro.build/play to see how Astro component-based composition works in a single page.

## Project

The "My Learning Astro Blog" that you will build has many of the features you would expect in a developer blog: an About page, a Contact page, and a Blog Index page linking to individual blog posts. The finished blog will be deployed to the web, and can even be used as a personal website once you have completed this tutorial!

After completing the tutorial, your finished blog will look like this:

## Structure

### Where to start

This tutorial is designed to accommmodate people with differing level of web development experience. Feel free to skip ahead to [Astro Pages](/en/tutorial/2-astro-pages/) if you have already created a new Astro project and are ready to jump right into the code.

### Additional Learning

In addition to the steps to complete your project, there are opportunities to test your knowlege along the way and links to further resources. These are not required, but may help solidify some of the core Astro concepts.

### Tracking your progress

At the end of each lesson, there is a checklist for moving on so you can be sure you are familiar with the knowledge and skills covered on each page. If you choose to complete these checklists, your progress will be visible on the Progress Status page.
